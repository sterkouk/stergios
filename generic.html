										<h1>Microsoft Student Partner (MSP)</h1>

									<p>
										During my time at university, I was fortunate to be a Microsoft Student Partner (MSP) for two years. This role was part of the global Microsoft Learn Ambassador community, which allowed me to deeply engage with Microsoft technologies and contribute to the local developer community. As an MSP, I organized various events, workshops, and hackathons, fostering collaboration and skill-sharing among students. 
									</p>
									<p>
										I worked on projects showcasing Microsoft technologies such as C#, Azure, and Microsoft ML Studio. A key area of my focus was bot development using LUIS (Language Understanding Intelligent Service), where I gained hands-on experience building intelligent chatbots. Additionally, I developed solutions with Azure Cloud services to enable scalable and efficient applications.
									</p>
									<p>
										This experience not only sharpened my technical abilities, but also allowed me to learn how to effectively cooperate within a team environment. Leading small university projects gave me valuable insights into project management, communication, and time management, which I now apply in professional settings. It was a transformative experience that helped me grow both as a developer and a collaborator.

									<h2>Team Collaboration & Leadership</h2>
									<p>
										Besides technical development, the MSP program helped me hone my skills in teamwork and leadership. I collaborated with diverse teams, coordinated events, and mentored peers, which helped me build a solid foundation in managing small projects. The ability to work effectively in a team and manage resources efficiently was crucial in completing projects on time and with high quality.
